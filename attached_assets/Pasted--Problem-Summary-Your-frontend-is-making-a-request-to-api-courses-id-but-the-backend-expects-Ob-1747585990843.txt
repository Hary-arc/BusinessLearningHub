üîç Problem Summary
Your frontend is making a request to /api/courses/:id, but the backend expects ObjectId format for course _id. However:

In some DB lookups, you're matching on id (string/number).

In others, you're matching on _id (Mongo ObjectId).

This inconsistency can cause your course detail route to fail with 404 or data mismatches.

‚úÖ Fixes & Recommendations
1. ‚úÖ Ensure All Course Documents Use _id: ObjectId
In your seed data (fallback data in /api/courses), you‚Äôre inserting documents like:

ts
Copy
Edit
const seedCourses = [{
  id: 1,
  title: "Introduction to Web Development",
  ...
  published: true
}];
üëâ Fix: Mongo will not generate _id automatically if you manually define id. But your /api/courses/:id route depends on _id.

Replace id: 1 with MongoDB's native _id generation:

ts
Copy
Edit
const { ObjectId } = require("mongodb");

const seedCourses = [{
  _id: new ObjectId(),
  title: "Introduction to Web Development",
  ...
  isPublished: true
}];
And remove id field unless you absolutely need both.

2. ‚úÖ Fix Inconsistent courseId Matching
In several places, you use courseId.toString() or match against id. This causes trouble when mixing ObjectIds and strings.

For example, in enrollments:

ts
Copy
Edit
.findOne({ id: validatedData.courseId });
But the frontend sends courseId as an _id (ObjectId string) from Mongo. So this match fails.

üëâ Fix: Normalize all course references to use _id (and ObjectId).

Change:

ts
Copy
Edit
.findOne({ id: validatedData.courseId });
To:

ts
Copy
Edit
.findOne({ _id: new ObjectId(validatedData.courseId) });
Do the same in all lookup, find, and insert calls for consistency.

3. ‚úÖ Make Sure Lessons Use courseId: ObjectId as well
In /api/courses/:id, you fetch lessons like this:

ts
Copy
Edit
.find({ courseId: courseId.toString() })
This assumes courseId is a string, but you should ideally store it as an ObjectId in the lesson documents.

Fix:

Update the lesson schema to store courseId: ObjectId.

Change the query to:

ts
Copy
Edit
.find({ courseId })
4. ‚úÖ Update /api/courses/:id/reviews Route
You're parsing courseId as parseInt(req.params.id), which assumes a number-based ID:

ts
Copy
Edit
const courseId = parseInt(req.params.id);
This won‚Äôt work if you're using Mongo ObjectIds.

üëâ Fix:

ts
Copy
Edit
const { ObjectId } = require('mongodb');
const courseId = new ObjectId(req.params.id);
Also ensure your reviews are stored with courseId: ObjectId.

5. üß™ Add Logging and Better Error Handling
In your /api/courses/:id route, wrap important sections in logs:

ts
Copy
Edit
console.log("Looking for course with ID", courseId);
And for failures:

ts
Copy
Edit
console.error("Failed to fetch lessons:", err);
üõ† Optional Improvements
üîê req.isAuthenticated() may not always exist
This method comes from passport.js. If you're using a custom auth system, this might throw.

If it's failing silently, protect it:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (!req.isAuthenticated || !req.isAuthenticated()) {
  return res.status(401).json({ message: "Not authenticated" });
}
Or write a middleware like:

ts
Copy
Edit
function requireAuth(req, res, next) {
  if (!req.isAuthenticated?.()) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
  next();
}
‚úÖ Action Plan Summary
Issue	Fix
id vs _id mismatch	Always use _id (Mongo ObjectId)
courseId mismatched types	Convert all to ObjectId
parseInt(req.params.id) on ObjectId	Use new ObjectId(req.params.id)
Missing lessons due to string match	Store lesson courseId as ObjectId
Hardcoded seed data id field	Replace with _id: new ObjectId()
Debugging	Add logs in key routes
